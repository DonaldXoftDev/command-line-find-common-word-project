## 🧠 Common Word Counter (Beginner Python Project)

This is a simple Python program I built to improve my understanding of **user input**, **text processing**, and **word counting** in Python. It allows the user to enter multiple sentences, and it then tells which word appears the most.

This project is beginner-friendly and doesn't use any external libraries — just basic Python!

---

### 🌟 What This Program Does

1. It asks the user to enter multiple sentences (one by one).
2. When the user types **"done"**, it combines all the sentences.
3. It removes punctuation and symbols (only letters are kept).
4. It counts how often each word appears.
5. It shows the word(s) that appear the most.



### 📌 Example


Enter each sentence one by one and then type "done" when you are done.
Enter a sentence: Learning Python is fun and useful.
Enter a sentence: Python helps me solve problems.
Enter a sentence: I love learning new things with Python.
Enter a sentence: done
python, learning occurs 2 times.


### ✅ Why I Built This

As someone new to programming, I wanted to:

* Practice **working with lists and dictionaries**
* Understand **how to take input from a user**
* Try **basic string cleaning** (removing symbols and extra characters)
* Learn how to **count things** using Python logic

---

### 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python 3 (no external libraries)

---

### 💻 How To Run It

1. Make sure Python is installed on your computer.
2. Save the code in a file called `common_word_counter.py`.
3. Open your terminal or command prompt.
4. Run the file with:

```bash
python common_word_counter.py
```

5. Follow the instructions in the terminal.

### 🔍 What I Learned

* How to collect input from users using `input()`
* How to loop through lists and strings
* How to clean text and remove unwanted characters
* How to use dictionaries to count things
* How to find the highest value in a dictionary

---

### 📚 Next Steps (What I Might Add Later)

* Option to ignore common words like "the", "is", "and", etc.
* Ability to read text from a file instead of typing manually
* Display all word frequencies, not just the top one
